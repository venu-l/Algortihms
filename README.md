# Algortihms
I love faster code - So, I do love Algorithms and This is a subset of my Algorithm Collection. 
I feel being able to share and reuse the code is the biggest benefit for us being in the Software Industry.
Feel free to give feedback, suggestions on any of my code. I would love to improve. 

Apart from Algorithms, 
I love Data! 
I love Customers! (and yes! I love understanding customers through Data!)
I love Singing, Skydiving, HorseRiding! 

If you have similar combination of intersts, ping me!

What if every computational problem can be solved in super-linear time? 
Would the Earth start rotating faster? :P :P :P
